**As a user (developer) I can use a scaffolding tool so that I can generate the structure of a hub-ready app**

### Concept
Providing a scaffolding mechanism to users (specifically developers) will decrease the requisite start-up time to create an app. Moving from zero to a hub-ready app will take less time, and require less research, likely increasing the quantity and quality of applications for users to interact with.

### Acceptance Criteria

- User can run a scaffolding command, which creates a series of files and actions that work in concert to generate a hub ready app

### Design

- No design

### Technical

Description of the general things that need to be done.
